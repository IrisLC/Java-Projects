# Java-Projects
This repository is a collection of my various java projects throughout my time being a Computer Science Minor, studying at Miami Univeristy.
Most of these are just small projects done in class, assigned by teachers, but hopefully this repository serves as a show of my experience with java and Object Oriented Programming.
