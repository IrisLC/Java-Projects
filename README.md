# Java-Projects
This repository is a collection of various java projects from my 2 years of minoring in computer science at Miami University. All of these projects are based off of assignments given by my various professors in class, and any files marked with a * are made up of code provided for the assignment to get the required coding to work.

The classes that that these projects were for are, in order:
1. Fundamentals of Programming and Problem Solving
2. Object Oriented Programming
3. Data abstractions and structures (currently taking)
