# Java-Projects
This repository is a collection of various java projects from my 2 years of minoring in computer science at Miami University. All of these projects are based off of assignments given by my various professors in class, and any files marked with a * are made up of code provided for the assignment to get the required coding to work. Additionally, all projects are included with the frameowrk to run in the Eclipse IDE, as that is what most of the projects were coded in.

The classes that that these projects were for are, in order:
1. Fundamentals of Programming and Problem Solving
2. Object Oriented Programming
3. Data abstractions and structures (currently taking)
